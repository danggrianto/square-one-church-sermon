Emotional health => Depression

## What's our role as a Church?

3 Things we need to communicate with them:

1. God cares about **everything** in your life

    ```preformatted
    May your whole spirit, soul and body kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
    ```
   *1 Thesasalonians 5:23*

2. It's okay to not to be okay

    It's not a sin to be sick
    ```preformatted
    If you are walking in darkness, without a ray of light, trust in the Lord and rely on your God
    ```
    *Isaiah 50:10*

    No one invulnerable. Everyone needs help.
    You don't need to pretend. You can express yourself.
    Jesus expressed himself.
    - Jesus weep (Luke 19:41)
    - Jesus is overwhelmed (Mark 14:34)
    - Jesus is angry (Mark 3:5)
    - Jesus is full of joy (Luke 10:21)
    - Jesus is amazed (Luke 7:9)

3. You are not alone (Community)

    ```preformatted
    a person standing alone can be accaked and defeated, but two can stand back-toback and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken
    ```
    *Ecclesiastes 4:12*

    Most of the time we take it lightly when someone told us about depression, especially teenagers.

    Build a support system around it.
