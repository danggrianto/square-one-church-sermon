# Those People 3: Critical People

Sunday, July 15, 2018

**Constructive** vs **Destructive** criticism

1. God help me overcome my critical nature
Romans 8:1
```
Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus
```

2. God, help me know when to dismiss invalid criticism 

1 Peter 2:23
```
When they hurled their insurts at Jesus, he did not retaliate
```

In NIV **Revile**: to criticize in an abusive or angrily insulting manner

Craig Groeschel
```
Don't let COMPLIMENTS get in your head, and don't let CRITICSM get in your heart
```

3. God help me to know when to **respond** to criticism

Not all criticism toward you deserve a response.
Responding vs Reacting

Proverbs 14:29 NLT
```
People with understanding control their anger; a hot tempre shows great foolishness
```

Jesus was always criticized no matter what He did.

Jesus didn't pay attention because He was focusing on the mission.
